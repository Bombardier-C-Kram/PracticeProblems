<h3 id="workshop-layout">Workshop Layout</h3>

<p>Notes are sufficient for students to learn the basic constructs needed to solve the problems on each page. The accompanying video may contain additional explanations, visualisations and analogies to aid understanding. Instructors are advised to deliver this content “live” (in real time) so that students can ask questions as they arise. Independent learners can use the materials as provided.</p>

<p>Initially, concepts are sufficiently explained so that the students only need to apply them to the problems given. As the course progresses, students are given examples and should discover the behaviour for themselves.</p>

<p>Although this course provides an order of modules, it should be perfectly fine to shuffle sessions around and address certain topics sooner than otherwise. It is possible that in conversations and students’ questioning it will be worthwhile to introduce things not yet introduced.</p>

<h3 id="selecting-from-arrays">Selecting from Arrays</h3>
<p>The first few sessions are designed to teach array-oriented approaches to problems which are often framed as a loop over a sequence of logical statements. In fact, in some courses, control structures are taught under the title of “selection”. A sum as a reduction over a list (as opposed to the incrementataion of an accumulator, as is used when counting using one’s fingers), together with implicit mapping of scalar functions, are two foundational concepts in array programming.</p>

<p>It is said that APLers have over 100 words for indexing, by people who are wrong. I’ve so far counted <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">5</code> (there are more) and here they are.</p>

<pre><code class="language-APL">      A←2 3 4⍴⎕A
      A[1 2;3;]                  ⍝ Simple Bracket Indexing
      2 3⌷A                      ⍝ Squad Indexing
      A[(1 1 1)(2 1 4)(1 3 4)]   ⍝ Choose Indexing

      nest←2 3⍴'DY' 'AL' 'OG' ⍬ (⍬((2 2)2)) ⍬
      nest[⊂(2 2)2]             ⍝ Reach Indexing
      (2 2)2⊃nest               ⍝ Pick
      S←((⊃⊣)⌷⊢)⍤0 99   
      (1 1)(1 2 1)(1 2 2) S A   ⍝ Select

<h3 id="language-learning">Language Learning</h3>

<p>Learning APL can be more like learning a natural language</p>
<ul>
  <li>Learn in the native script (no romanisation / wordification of symbolic constructs)</li>
  <li>Produce output from the beginning
    <ul>
      <li>Have output corrected by “native speaker” (experienced user)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Frequent input and exposure to model</li>
</ul>

<p>Not every word or construct needs to be explicitly introduced before use or reference. Observing the use of words which one doesn’t understand is normal at the beginning of learning a language. Often seeing the result in context is enough to at least know “what is going on”.</p>

<h3 id="terminology-1">Terminology</h3>

<p>It might be worth putting together a guide to the spoken language APL. Many functions are spoken by their function name in context, while others have colloquially adopted the symbol to refer to one of their common uses.</p>

<div class="tab">
	<input type="checkbox" id="1" />
	<label class="tab-label" for="1">&nbsp;Hint:</label>
	<div class="tab-content">
		APL is fun for the whole family!
	</div>

<strong>Note:</strong>


This function returns the prime numbers up to `⍵`. If I were dictating this to someone, I might say:
&gt; *Where two equals plus slash-bar zero equals jot-dot mod selfie iota omega*

However, it is generally best practice to give the function names:

&gt; *Where two equals the plus reduce-first (plus reduction along the first axis) of zero equals the residue outer-product selfie of the indices up to omega*

The expression translates more literally to English as:

&gt; *zero equals the modulus between all combinations of numbers from one to the integer right argument inclusive*

&gt; *Positive integers up to ⍵ which have two factors*

```APL
      Primes←{⍸2=+⌿0=∘.|⍨⍳⍵}   ⍝ Primes up to ⍵
```

<strong>Note:</strong>
Rho, rho, rho of X Always equals 1 Rho is dimension, rho rho rank. APL is fun!

<h3 id="user-defined-function-style">User defined function style</h3>
<p>I actually sometimes appreciate the tradfn header, as it gives me a quick hint at how this thing is to be called, and if proper names are used, also what the arguments/operands are supposed to hold. A dop using only ⍺ ⍵ ⍺⍺ ⍵⍵ gives no hints as to the purpose of anything, and you have to go hunting in a large one, to see if it is a function or an operator.</p>

<h3 id="pedagogy">Pedagogy</h3>
<p>Lessons roughly follow the structure:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>┌ 1. Introduction
│ 2. Activity
└ 3. Assessment
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Introductions give context or a link to prior learning.</p>

<p>All modules have activities; we learn by doing. Some modules have written notes and problems to solve, with content which models a written numbered exam. Some have more exploratory activities to help foster intuition.</p>

<p>Assessment comes in many forms. It could be just an indication that learners are ready to move on, or it could be more formal like an invigilated exam.</p>

<p>Some examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Use thumbs up/down to indicate readiness to move on</li>
  <li>Write or share with the class
    <ul>
      <li>3 things you have learned</li>
      <li>What you found easy</li>
      <li>What you found hard</li>
      <li>Something you would like to learn in the future</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Written test</li>
  <li>Problem solving</li>
  <li>Project work
  Implement a small application</li>
</ul>

<p>If possible, there should be a few short cycles of this structure within sessions. The assessments can help everyone to decide when to move on to new material, or if something needs reclarification. Discussions may indicate that a detour into some other material might be a good idea.</p>
